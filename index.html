                constellation of Orion admired for it's intricate details and colors.</p>

                softly with hidden colors,
                revealing a delicate world that was always there, just unseen.
                The nebula stands quietly among stars and distant galaxies, radiant and calm."</p>

            <p class="hubble-text">There's something about it that reminds me of you. The sense of gentleness, deep and

                Each star shines through the thick
                cosmic dust, painting soft shades of blue that shimmer gracefully. Though these stars are just
                passing through the same region of space, their light dances together as if they were dancing.</p>
