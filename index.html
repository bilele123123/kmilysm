            <p class="hubble-text">NASA captured the iconic Horsehead Nebula, a treasured cloud located in the
                constellation of Orion known for it's intricate details and colors.</p>

            <p class="hubble-text">Quoted from NASA, "In this new Hubble Space Telescope view, the nebula appears in a
                new light, as seen in
                infrared wavelengths. The nebula, shadowy in optical light, appears transparent and ethereal when seen
                in the infrared, represented here with visible shades. The rich tapestry of the Horsehead Nebula pops
                out against the backdrop of Milky Way stars and distant galaxies that are easily seen in infrared
                light."</p>

                the Seven Sisters, glowing like diamonds scattered on velvet. Each star shines through the thick
                cosmic dust, painting soft shades of blue that shimmer gracefully. Though these stars are just
                passing through the same region of space, their light dances together as if they were choreographed.</p>

            <p class="hubble-text">In pre-colonial Phillippines, the Pleiades is known as Mapulon, used to mark the
